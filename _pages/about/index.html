I received my B.E. in System Management Engineering from <strong>Sungkyunkwan University</strong>, and my M.S. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from <strong>GIST</strong>, where I worked in the <a href="https://iis.gist.ac.kr/isp/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">IIS Lab</a> with Prof. Euiseok Hwang.</p> <p>My research focuses on understanding complex <strong>stochastic dynamical systems</strong> through data-driven approaches.</p> <p>I am particularly interested in how the desirable properties of stochastic systems can be exploited across different subfields:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Machine Learning &amp; Optimization</strong>: randomized algorithms such as Langevin dynamics and randomized embeddings</li> <li> <strong>Decision Making under Uncertainty</strong>: conformal prediction and stochastic control</li> <li> <strong>Linearization Methods</strong>: kernel approaches and Koopman operator theory</li> </ul> </body></html>
