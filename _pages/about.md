Hi, I am **Minseok Jeong**, a Ph.D. student at the [KAIST ACSS Lab](http://acss.kaist.ac.kr/) under the supervision of Prof. Sujin Han. I received my B.E. in System Management Engineering from **Sungkyunkwan University**, and my M.S. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from **GIST**, where I worked in the [IIS Lab](https://iis.gist.ac.kr/isp/) with Prof. Euiseok Hwang.

My research focuses on understanding complex **stochastic dynamical systems** through data-driven approaches.

I am particularly interested in how the desirable properties of stochastic systems can be exploited across different subfields:
- **Machine Learning & Optimization**: randomized algorithms such as Langevin dynamics and randomized embeddings  
- **Decision Making under Uncertainty**: conformal prediction and stochastic control  
- **Linearization Methods**: kernel approaches and Koopman operator theory
