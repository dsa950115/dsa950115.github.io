Hi, I am **Minseok Jeong**, a Ph.D. student at [KAIST ACSS Lab](http://acss.kaist.ac.kr/) under the supervision of Prof. Sujin Han.  
I received my B.S. in Industrial Engineering from **Sungkyunkwan University**, and my M.S. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from **GIST**, where I worked in the [IIS Lab](https://iis.gist.ac.kr/isp/) with Prof. Euiseok Hwang.

My research interests lie in understanding complex dynamical systems through **linearization and stochastic modeling**, and leveraging the insights that emerge from this perspective.  

In particular, I am interested in exploring how desirable properties of stochastic systems can be utilized across various subfields:
- **Machine Learning & Optimization**: randomized algorithms such as Langevin dynamics and randomized embeddings  
- **Decision Making under Uncertainty**: conformal prediction, stochastic control  
- **Statistical Learning Theory**: understanding the sample complexity and generalization of algorithms
